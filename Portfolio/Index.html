      <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, starting college has had more downs than ups. It has been a challenge waking up early to go to
         an online class and spending hours of the day in front of a laptop. I'm sure many students can relate to this! The problem is, 
        no one is certain of anything... No one has prepared us and we are supposed to simply live it. Live 2 years inside our homes while 
        the government decides on our behalf what is best and what is not for us! Kinda ridiculous in my opinion but Oh Well... 
        Back to the college situation, I can't complain about the professors, we as a student can all see how much effort they are putting 
        on us and trying to get us into engaging in the classes. It's not easy for any side, but I believe that with a little push from them and 
        a little effort from us, we are able to go through this year. At this very moment, I am trying to get all my projects purged for 
        the last month of college. It's crazy how the year has gone by so rapidly... But I guess that's what college is about in one way, 
        you learn, you're accessed and you're off to work during the long summer days. </p>
      <p> My hopes are, this year the vaccines bring us some good news and hopefully bring us back to some normality too. </p>
      <p> Fingers crossed -A </p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Game Development is the art of creating games and describes the design, development and release of a game. 
        It may involve concept generation, design, build, test and release. While you create a game, it is important to think 
        about the game mechanics, rewards, player engagement and level design.</p>
      <p>Many people when they think about a game creator, they think of two things; A Game Designer and a Game Developer!</p>
      <p>Game designer and game developer are two very similar job titles you hear getting thrown around and many people assume 
        these terms mean the same thing. Both titles are alike, but the jobs themselves are quite different and students are generally 
        drawn to one role or the other. The best game designers are often creative people and they blend a number of different skills 
        together ranging from programming to graphic design and including animation and art. Designers dream up all the ideas that are 
        behind the game itself and often help come up with the games story. They design the initial framework and set out the flow of
         the game. Game developers are essentially programmers and focus more on the technical aspects of making the game. They have 
         a deep understanding of all the different languages used in game development and are really considered to be a software or 
         computer engineer. You’ll need to become an expert in languages such as C++, Perl, Lua and more, once you're rooting for Game
        Development. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>The word “media” applies to many things in the 21st century, from mass media to news media, and traditional media to 
        the many emerging forms of digital media. It comes from the Latin medius or medium, which means “the middle layer.” 
        Media is an expression that brings some type of information or entertainment from one body to another.</p>
      <p>Before the advent of the digital age, the most popular forms of media were what we now call analog or 
        traditional media: radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, journals, and the like. Since then, the technological 
        revolution has brought with it many new types of media that now play a major role in disseminating information 
        and entertainment to populations around the world. </p>
      <p>Unlike traditional media, digital media is transmitted as digital data, which at its simplest involves digital 
        cables or satellites sending binary signals –– 0s and 1s –– to devices that translate them into audio, video, graphics, 
        text, and more. Anytime you use your computer, tablet, or cellphone, opening web-based systems and apps, you’re 
        consuming digital media. Digital media might come in the form of videos, articles, advertisements, music, podcasts, 
        audiobooks, virtual reality, or digital art.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, or for a private 
        network known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, 
        it’s all about the coding and programming that powers the website’s functionality. Web development can 
        be broken down into three layers: client-side coding (frontend), server-side coding (backend) and database technology. </p>
      <p>Client-side scripting, or frontend development, refers to everything that the end user experiences directly. Client-side 
        code executes in a web browser and directly relates to what people see when they visit a website. Things like layout, fonts, 
        colours, menus and contact forms are all driven by the frontend.</p>
      <p>Server-side scripting, or backend development, is all about what goes on behind the scenes. The backend is essentially 
        the part of a website that the user doesn’t actually see. It is responsible for storing and organizing data, and ensuring that 
        everything on the client-side runs smoothly. It does this by communicating with the frontend. Whenever something happens 
        on the client-side — say, a user fills out a form — the browser sends a request to the server-side. The server-side “responds”
         with relevant information in the form of frontend code that the browser can then interpret and display.</p>
        <p>Websites also rely on database technology. The database contains all the files and content that are necessary for a 
          website to function, storing it in such a way that makes it easy to retrieve, organize, edit and save. The database runs 
          on a server, and most websites typically use some form of relational database management system (RDBMS).</p>
        <p>To summarize: the frontend, backend and database technology all work together to build and run a fully 
          functional website or application, and these three layers form the foundation of web development.</p>

      <h4><b>Introducing Me</b></h4>
      <p> Oie! My name is Andreina Carvalho, but most people calls me Drina for short.</p>
      <p> I'm a 1st Year student in AIT, who has lived almost 2 decades in this weird world. My roots are Brazilian but most times 
        I feel more Irish than Latina. My base is and always will be my family. I believe if you have your family by your side you don't need
        need to worry about anything else. They give me the motivation I need to focus on life and be a better version of myself each day.
        For those who believe in astrology signs, I'm Gemini and yes, I can some (most) times have quite a few personalities, but different
        from what they say, I don't consider myself untrusty at all! Quite the opposite, I rather help others and earn their respect for life. </p>
      <p> Enough about me.. I just would like to state that this Eportfolio is being made to show how much I've learned in my first year of 
        college, but also to show a little about me and what I do and use to facilitate my life when studying and doing my projects.
